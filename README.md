# ansible


#As part of my DevOps studies, I was asked to create an ansible role that does the following steps


#Update for Linux installation packages

#Installing the tree and htop packages (it was allowed to replace, add and change which tampering was allowed to be installed in the code of the role)

#Installing a webserver in my case Apache/httpd but allowed to change to ngnix, mysql or any software whose installation is done this way apt/yum install-what-we-want-to-install

#Copying files from the file folder inside the role (any type of file can be copied) into the servers located in the host file (we can change the file copying location by accessing 

#the code and changing the line "dest: /var/www/html" to "dest:/any/path/ we-want

#fanily Print how many RedHat and how many Debian (Ubuntu) hosts
